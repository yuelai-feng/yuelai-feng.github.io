Welcome! My name is Yuelai Feng (in Chinese: 冯越来). I also go by Mollie.

Born and raised in Shanghai, China, I graduated from [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/) with a Bachelor's degree in Computational and Systems Biology in 2024. I am currently gaining more research experience and preparing for a Ph.D. in (Computational) Neuroscience in the near future.

I am broadly interested in the neural algorithms that underlie our fundamental living experience, such as memory, learning, spatiotemporal perception, abstraction, and decision-making. I worked with [Dr. Mayank Mehta](https://mayank.pa.ucla.edu/) at UCLA and studied the role of hippocampus in spatial perception and abstraction. I enjoy both the experimental and the computational / theoretical aspects of neuroscience research.

When I'm not doing research, I enjoy traveling, [taking photos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/N9PXKGZJmQzVzKk39), playing tennis, doodling, petting dogs, and reading about neuroscience & consciousness.
