# *Hello! Welcome.*

I am currently a research technician at [Jazayeri Lab](http://jazlab.org) at [MIT McGovern Institute for Brain Research](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/). Before that, I completed my B.S. in computational and systems biology at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/).

I am boardly interested in how neural dynamics give rise to animals' flexible minds and behaviors. I am especially interested in topics of memorization, learning, and generalization.

Besides research, I also enjoy traveling, making travel plans, [taking photos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/N9PXKGZJmQzVzKk39), writing calligraphy on greeting cards, and playing tennis.
