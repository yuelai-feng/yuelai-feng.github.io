# *About*

My name is 冯越来 (fung-yueh-lie). I usually go by Mollie in real life because it requires less explanation. Also, nobody really calls me by my first name in China (it's either my full name or other nicknames) and I grew up having this English name, so Mollie actually feels more natural to me!

I grew up in Shanghai, China. In 2021, after completing my freshman year fully online, I moved to the US for college. I completed my bachelor's degree in computational and systems biology at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/). Currently, I'm a research technician at [Jazayeri Lab](http://jazlab.org) at [MIT McGovern Institute for Brain Research](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/).

I am boardly interested in how neural dynamics give rise to flexible minds and behaviors. I am especially interested in topics of memorization, learning, and generalization.

Besides research, I also enjoy traveling, making travel plans, [taking photos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/N9PXKGZJmQzVzKk39), writing calligraphy on greeting cards, and playing tennis.
