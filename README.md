Hello! My name is Yuelai Feng (冯越来). You can call me Yuelai or Mollie. 

Born and raised in Shanghai, China, I am now pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computational and Systems Biology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

As an aspiring computational neuroscientist, I am broadly interested in the neural algorithms underlying our fundamental living experience: memory, learning, spatiotemporal perception, abstraction, and decision making. Read more about my neuroscience research journey here.

Besides research, I also enjoy writing about science for the general public (in English and in Chinese). Read my science writing and translation works here.

In my free time, I also do photography, calligraphy, drawing, graphic designs, and other visual art-related things for fun. Check out my artsy side here.

I can be reached at yuelaif [at] ucla [dot] edu.
