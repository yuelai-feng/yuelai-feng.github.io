# *about*

My name is 冯越来 (fung-yueh-lie). I usually go by Mollie.

I'm currently a research technician at [Jazayeri Lab](http://jazlab.org) at [MIT's McGovern Institute](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/). I completed my bachelor's degree in computational and systems biology at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/).

As a neuroscientist in training, I'm broadly interested in how neural dynamics give rise to higher cognition and flexible behavior. More specifically, I'd like to explore how memory and knowledge is acquired, maintained, and used in the brain. 

In my free time, I enjoy traveling, [taking photos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/N9PXKGZJmQzVzKk39), practicing calligraphy, and playing tennis.
