Welcome! My name is Yuelai Feng (冯越来). I also go by Mollie.

Born and raised in Shanghai, China, I graduated from UCLA with a Bachelor's degree in Computational and Systems Biology in 2024.

### Education  
* **B.S., Computational and Systems Biology (2020-2024)**  
  *University of California, Los Angeles*

### Research Interests  
I am interested in the neural algorithms underlying our fundamental living experience: memory, learning, spatiotemporal perception, abstraction, and decision making.

Besides research, I also enjoy writing about science for the general public (in English and in Chinese). Read my science writing and translation works here.

In my free time, I also do photography, calligraphy, drawing, graphic designs, and other visual art-related things for fun.
