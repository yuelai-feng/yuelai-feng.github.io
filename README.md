Welcome! My name is Yuelai Feng (冯越来). I also go by Mollie.

Born and raised in Shanghai, China, I graduated from UCLA with a Bachelor's degree in Computational and Systems Biology in 2024.

### Education  
* **B.S., Computational and Systems Biology (2020-2024)**  
  *University of California, Los Angeles*

### Research Interests  
I am interested in the neural algorithms underlying our fundamental living experience: memory, learning, spatiotemporal perception, abstraction, and decision making.

When I'm not doing research, I enjoy traveling, [taking photos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/N9PXKGZJmQzVzKk39), calligraphy/doodling, and reading about neuroscience.
